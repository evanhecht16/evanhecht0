            <p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them to the finals more than others.
                Did
                Giannis do it without help? <em>Not really.</em> Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is LeBron
                amazing? Yes.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this already. So I figured I would add
                my
                data-driven take to the mix. What do the data say about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in NBA
                history?</p>
            <p>The data say that LeBron’s (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers reigns supreme.</p>
            <p class="greentext"> <em>Advanced stat haters should stop reading.</em></p>
            <p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat <a
                    href=" https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/" target="_blank">
                    RAPTOR WAR (WAR)
                </a>created by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">538</a>, a good measure for
                how many wins a player contributed vs. what a replacement level player would. But we can’t just
                measure
                who had the highest WAR in isolation since both games and minutes played factor in. It needs to be
                relative to the rest of the team.</p>

    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <div class="col-lg-4 offset-lg-1 ">
            <p>This chart shows a player's WAR in the playoffs vs. their minutes played for every team in the
                NBA finals since 1997. Players with more uniform impact are clustered closer together, and those
                with standout performances are higher and more separated.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#" class="chart">2005 pistons</a> represents the "no 'I' in team" philosophy.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#" class="chart">1998 Bulls</a> and the <a href="#" class="chart">2020 Lakers</a> are
                prime examples
                of a
                dynamic duo.</p>
            <p>And finally we have Duncan leading the <a href="#" class="chart">2003 Spurs</a>, Wade with <a href="#"
                    class="chart">2006
                    Heat</a>, and LeBron basically every year, but notably with the <a href="#" class="chart">2018
                    Cavs</a>
                representing the single-handed carry jobs.</p>

        <p class="explainer">To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look at the WAR share among the top three
            players on a
            team.
            I could’ve picked any number of players to compare, but most great teams have at least two or three
            stars, with the rest filling in as role players, so three is the magic number.</p>

        <p class="footer">Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players with 150+ minutes
            played. There are
            a lot of metrics out there, and they can all be great and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so
            a cumulative stat was chosen.</p>
