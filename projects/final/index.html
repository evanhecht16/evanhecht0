                <p>The Billboard Hot 100 is a staple in the music industry, evaluating record chart data on a weekly
                    basis. Since its inception in 1954, the chart has grown larger and larger to become not only an
                    industry staple but also a coveted and important moniker for fans.</p>

                <p>“The Billboard charts are really important when reflecting on the work we've done behind the scenes
                    to develop artists,” Said Delaney Engel.

                    Engel is Strategic Partnerships Representative for the °1824 team at Universal Music Group.

            we
            connect with partnerships and different brand opportunities to create</p>
        <p class="quote1"> a strong outreach to make these songs
            reach the top of the chart in addition to seeing if the artist would thrive within certain demographics and
            certain communities,” Engel said.</p>
