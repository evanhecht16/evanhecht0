        <h1>The Billboard Hot 100 Reflects the Gender Disparity in the Music Industry</h1>
        <h6><em>The music industry has longtime been a boys club, and the Hot 100 only further reflects that.</em></h6>
        <h4>By Evan Hecht</h4>

    <p>The Billboard Hot 100 is a staple in the music industry, evaluating record chart data on a weekly basis for over
        65 years.

        Since its inception in 1954, the chart has grown to become not only an industry staple but also a coveted and
        important moniker for fans.

            <div class="col-md-6">
                It kind of is more of a reflection on us to see how did we market them, did we develop them in a&r
                well did we connect with partnerships and different brand opportunities to create strong outreach to
                make these songs reach the top of the chart in addition to seeing if the artist would thrive within
                certain demographics and certain communities,” said Delaney Engel.

    <p>But while it represents the hard work behind the scenes from marketers and performers, it also represents deeper
        issues rooted in the music industry.

        The music industry has not always fostered an environment of equal opportunity. Music has been historically
        male-dominated and allowed for less opportunity for women.

        This once antiquated standard is still reflected today in the status quo of the Billboard Hot 100.

    </p>

    <p>I wanted to take a look and track the weekly data from the beginning of Fall 2021 semester till November 28th. I
        specifically looked at the top five spots of each week, allotting for 70 total spots over 14 weeks of data.</p>

    <div class="align-items-center">
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class=" offset-md-1 col-md-4">
                <img src="img/img3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="data chart 1">
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>From my findings, only 12 of the 70 were held by women, <em>accounting for 17% of the share of
                        the top
                        spots.</em> Those 12 spots were held by five, four if you don’t count a featured female
                    artist, women in
                    total: Doja Cat, SZA, Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift and Adele.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row align-items-center">
        <div class=" offset-md-1 col-md-6">
            <p>And while six of those 12 spots were the number one slot, I feel as if that data reflects a unique
                situation. The 24th to the 14th of November gave Adele the number one spot for “Easy on Me,” her
                first release since her 2016 album <em>25</em>. The 21st and 28th were given to Taylor Swift’s “All
                Too Well
                (Taylor’s Version)” after the much anticipated re-release of her album <em>Red</em>. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <img src="img/img4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="data chart 2">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="p1">This is not meant to diminish the accomplishments of these women, but it does provide unique
        scenarios.

    </p>

    <p>Gender discrepancy goes beyond just the Hot 100. In 2018 the Grammys came under fire for the
        resounding number of female artists nominated compared to the amount who walked away with awards that night. For
        example, in 2018 Ed Sheeran won Best Pop Vocal Performance Solo, as the only male nominated in that category.

    </p>
    <p> That same year, Lorde was the only woman nominated for Album of the Year.

        Former Grammy president Neil Portnow came under fire for stating, “women need to step up,” when asked about the
        award show results that year. Portnow came under fire for the comments

    </p>

    <p>Yet regardless of the status quo, Engel does not see different treatment given to different genders in the
        industry. “I think it depends on what the artist as an artist produces, not necessarily their gender,” she said.
    </p>

    <p> Regardless of the status quo, women in music continue to prevail each and everyday as they continue to shatter
        the glass ceiling. Whether it’s creating new achievements or the continuous pushing of their art, women in music
        will continue to thrive and excel.</p>
