        <h1>Gender Disparity in the Billboard Hot 100</h1>
        <h4>By Evan Hecht</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The Billboard Hot 100 is a staple in the music industry, evaluating record chart data on a weekly
        basis. Since its inception in 1954, the chart has grown larger and larger to become not only an
        industry staple but also a coveted and important moniker for fans.</p>

    <p>“The Billboard charts are really important when reflecting on the work we've done behind the scenes
        to develop artists,” Said Delaney Engel.

        Engel is Strategic Partnerships Representative for the °1824 team at Universal Music Group.

                    “It kind of is more of a reflection on us to see how did we market them, did we develop them in A&R
                    well
                    did
                    we
                    connect with partnerships and different brand opportunities to create a strong outreach to make
                    these songs
                    reach the top of the chart in addition to seeing if the artist would thrive within certain
                    demographics
                    and
                    certain communities,” Engel said. </p>
            </div>

    <p class="p1">So to put it simply, the Hot 100 reflects the industry. And while it represents the hard work, it
        also represents deeper issues rooted in the music industry.

        The music industry has not always fostered an environment of equal opportunity. Music has been
        historically male-dominated and allowed for less opportunity for women.

        This once antiquated standard is unfortunately still reflected today in the status quo of the
        Billboard Hot 100.
    </p>

    <p>I wanted to take a look and track the weekly data from the beginning of Fall 2021 semester till November 28th. I
        specifically looked at the top five spots of each week, allotting for 70 total spots over 14 weeks of data.</p>

    <div class="align-items-center">
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="img/img3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="data chart 1">
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>From my findings, only 12 of the 70 spots were held by women. Those 12 spots were held by five, four
                    if you don’t count a featured female artist, women in total: Doja Cat, SZA, Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor
                    Swift and Adele.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="p2">And while six of those 12 spots were the number one slot, I feel as if that data reflects a unique
        situation. The
        24th to the 14th of November gave Adele the number one spot for “Easy on Me,” her first release since her 2016
        album 25. The 21st and 28th were given to Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)” after the much
        anticipated re-release of her album Red.
    </p>

    <p class="p3">This is not meant to diminish the accomplishments of these women, but it does provide unique
        scenarios.
    </p>



    <div class="align-items-center">
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Gender discrepancy goes beyond just the Hot 100. In 2018 the Grammys came under fire for the
                    resounding number of
                    female artists nominated compared to the amount who walked away with awards that night. For example,
                    in 2018 Ed
                    Sheeran won Best Pop Vocal Performance Solo, as the only male nominated in that category. That same
                    year, Lorde
                    was the only woman nominated for Album of the Year. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="img/img4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="data chart 2">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="p2">Former Grammy president Neil Portnow came under fire for stating, “women need to step up,” when asked
        about the
        award show results that year. Portnow came under fire for the comments

        Yet regardless of the status quo, Engel does not see different treatment given to different genders in the
        industry. “I think it depends on what the artist as an artist produces, not necessarily their gender,” she said.
    </p>

    <p>Regardless of the status quo, women in music continue to prevail each and everyday as they continue to shatter
        the glass ceiling. Whether it’s creating new achievements or the continuous pushing of their art, women in music
        will continue to thrive and excel.</p>
